## 🚀 Students Can Now Take Exam

After running the SQL script:
1. ✅ All 31 students can login to exam portal
2. ✅ They use their roll number + unique code "fsmba2026"
3. ✅ Each student can take exam only once
4. ✅ Results automatically save to Supabase

## 🔍 Common Tasks

### Check who hasn't taken exam yet
```sql
SELECT s.roll_number 
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN exam_results e ON s.roll_number = e.roll_number
WHERE e.id IS NULL AND s.is_active = true
ORDER BY s.roll_number;
```

### Check who has taken exam
```sql
SELECT 
    e.roll_number, 
    e.correct_answers,
    e.wrong_answers,
    e.percentage,
    e.violation_detected,
    e.violation_type,
    e.created_at
FROM exam_results e
INNER JOIN students s ON e.roll_number = s.roll_number
ORDER BY e.created_at DESC;
```

### Disable a student (if needed)
```sql
UPDATE students 
SET is_active = false 
WHERE roll_number = 'ROLL_NUMBER_HERE';
```

### Re-enable a student
```sql
UPDATE students 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE roll_number = 'ROLL_NUMBER_HERE';
```

## 📁 Files Reference

| `ADD_NEW_STUDENTS.sql` | SQL script to add 12 new students |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **All students use same code:** `fsmba2026`
2. **One exam per student:** System enforces this automatically
3. **Violations tracked:** Tab switches, ESC presses logged in Supabase
4. **20 questions per exam:** Random selection from 200+ question bank
5. **30 minutes time limit:** Auto-submits when time expires

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Student can't login
1. Check if roll number exists in students table
2. Verify `is_active = true`
3. Confirm unique code is exactly `fsmba2026` (case sensitive)
4. Check if student already took exam

### SQL script errors
- Error "duplicate key": Student already exists (this is OK)
- Error "table doesn't exist": Run `CREATE_STUDENTS_TABLE.sql` first
- Error "permission denied": Check Supabase access level

### Need to reset a student's exam
```sql
-- ⚠️ Use with caution - this deletes their results
DELETE FROM exam_results 
WHERE roll_number = 'ROLL_NUMBER_HERE';
```
