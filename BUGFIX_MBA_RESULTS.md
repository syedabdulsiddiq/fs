# Bug Fix: MBA Regular Exam Results Not Saving

## 🐛 Issue Identified

MBA Regular exam results were showing on frontend but not saving to Supabase `mba_regular_exam_results` table.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Schema Mismatch:** The code was trying to insert columns that don't exist in the `mba_regular_exam_results` table:
- ❌ Tried to insert: `score`, `shuffled_questions`, `exam_date`, `exam_completed`
- ✅ Actual table has: `additional_data` (JSONB column)

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated `supabase-config.js` to match the actual table schema:

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
{
    roll_number: rollNumber,
    correct_answers: correctAnswers,
    wrong_answers: wrongAnswers,
    total_questions: totalQuestions,
    percentage: percentage,
    score: `${correctAnswers}/${totalQuestions}`,        // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    user_answers: userAnswers,
    shuffled_questions: shuffledQuestions,                // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    exam_date: new Date().toISOString(),                  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    exam_completed: true,                                 // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    violation_detected: violationDetected,
    violation_type: violationType
}
```

### After (Correct):
```javascript
{
    roll_number: rollNumber,
    correct_answers: correctAnswers,
    wrong_answers: wrongAnswers,
    total_questions: totalQuestions,
    percentage: percentage,
    user_answers: userAnswers,
    violation_detected: violationDetected,
    violation_type: violationType,
    additional_data: {                                    // ✅ Store extra data here
        score: `${correctAnswers}/${totalQuestions}`,
        shuffled_questions: shuffledQuestions,
        exam_date: new Date().toISOString(),
        exam_completed: true
    }
}
```

## 📋 Table Schema

### mba_regular_exam_results
```sql
CREATE TABLE mba_regular_exam_results (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    roll_number TEXT NOT NULL,
    correct_answers INTEGER NOT NULL,
    wrong_answers INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_questions INTEGER NOT NULL,
    percentage NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    user_answers JSONB,
    additional_data JSONB,              -- Store score, exam_date, etc.
    violation_type TEXT,
    violation_detected BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Refresh Browser:** Press Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Login MBA Regular:**
   - Roll Number: 160525672001
   - Unique Code: fsmba03
3. **Complete Exam:** Answer questions and submit
4. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mba_regular_exam_results 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ Results display on frontend
- ✅ Data saved in `mba_regular_exam_results` table
- ✅ All fields populated correctly
- ✅ `additional_data` contains score, exam_date, shuffled_questions

---

## 🔧 Additional Fix

Also updated `checkExamStatus()` to not check for non-existent `exam_completed` field:

### Before:
```javascript
.eq('exam_completed', true)  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
```

### After:
```javascript
// Just check if any record exists for this roll_number
.eq('roll_number', rollNumber)
```

## 📊 Verification Queries

### Check if results are saving:
```sql
SELECT 
    roll_number,
    correct_answers,
    wrong_answers,
    percentage,
    violation_detected,
    created_at
FROM mba_regular_exam_results
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### View additional_data:
```sql
SELECT 
    roll_number,
    additional_data->>'score' as score,
    additional_data->>'exam_date' as exam_date,
    additional_data->>'exam_completed' as completed
FROM mba_regular_exam_results;
```

### Count total exams:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mba_regular_exam_results;
```
