# 🎉 Deployment Complete - Dual Exam System

## ✅ System Ready!

Your exam portal now supports **TWO independent exam systems** in a single deployment!

---

## 📊 System Overview

### FSMBA Exam System
- **Students:** 31
- **Unique Code:** `fsmba2026`
- **Questions:** 200+ DSA questions across 9 modules
- **Distribution:** 2 from M1, 3 from M2&M3, 2 from M4-M9 (20 total)
- **Tables:** `students`, `exam_results`

### MBA Regular Exam System  
- **Students:** 229 (160525672001 to 160525672229)
- **Unique Code:** `fsmba03`
- **Questions:** 150 TallyPrime questions across 6 modules
- **Distribution:** 3 from M1, 3 from M2, 4 from M3, 4 from M4, 3 from M5, 3 from M6 (20 total)
- **Tables:** `mba_regular_students`, `mba_regular_exam_results`

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Detection
1. Student enters roll number + unique code
2. System detects code:
   - `fsmba2026` → FSMBA exam (DSA questions)
   - `fsmba03` → MBA Regular exam (TallyPrime questions)
3. Loads appropriate questions from respective modules
4. Saves results to correct table

### Question Selection Logic

**FSMBA (DSA):**
- 2 questions from Module 1
- 3 questions from Module 2
- 3 questions from Module 3
- 2 questions from Modules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Total: 20 questions**

**MBA Regular (TallyPrime):**
- 3 questions from Module 1 (Accounting & GST Basics)
- 3 questions from Module 2 (Company Creation & Ledgers)
- 4 questions from Module 3 (Inventory Management)
- 4 questions from Module 4 (Vouchers & Transactions)
- 3 questions from Module 5 (Reports & Financial Statements)
- 3 questions from Module 6 (Integrated Accounting)
- **Total: 20 questions**

## 📋 Final Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Run SQL Scripts in Supabase ⚡

Open: https://wofjapxwmowdhxchcjqs.supabase.co

#### A. Add MBA Regular Students (if not done)
```sql
-- Run: CREATE_MBA_REGULAR_TABLES.sql
-- This creates 229 students with code fsmba03
```

#### B. Add New FSMBA Students (if not done)
```sql
-- Run: ADD_NEW_STUDENTS.sql  
-- This adds 12 students to FSMBA system
```

#### C. Add Violation Columns (if not done)
```sql
-- Run to both tables:
ALTER TABLE exam_results 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS violation_type TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS violation_detected BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

ALTER TABLE mba_regular_exam_results 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS violation_type TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS violation_detected BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables ✅

```sql
-- Check FSMBA students
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
-- Expected: 31

-- Check MBA Regular students  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mba_regular_students;
-- Expected: 229

-- Check both results tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exam_results;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mba_regular_exam_results;
```

### Step 3: Test Both Systems 🧪

#### Test FSMBA System
1. Go to: http://localhost:8000 (or Vercel URL)
2. Enter roll number: `160525672002`
3. Enter unique code: `fsmba2026`
4. Verify DSA questions load
5. Complete exam and check results save

#### Test MBA Regular System
1. Go to same website
2. Enter roll number: `160525672001`
3. Enter unique code: `fsmba03`
4. Verify TallyPrime questions load
5. Complete exam and check results save

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### Check Who Has Taken Exam

**FSMBA:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exam_results;
```

**MBA Regular:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mba_regular_exam_results;
```

### View Recent Results

**FSMBA:**
```sql
SELECT roll_number, percentage, violation_detected, created_at 
FROM exam_results 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**MBA Regular:**
```sql
SELECT roll_number, percentage, violation_detected, created_at 
FROM mba_regular_exam_results 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Find Students Who Haven't Taken Exam

**FSMBA:**
```sql
SELECT s.roll_number 
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN exam_results e ON s.roll_number = e.roll_number
WHERE e.id IS NULL AND s.is_active = true;
```

**MBA Regular:**
```sql
SELECT s.roll_number 
FROM mba_regular_students s
LEFT JOIN mba_regular_exam_results e ON s.roll_number = e.roll_number
WHERE e.id IS NULL AND s.is_active = true;
```

## 🔒 Security Features (Both Systems)

Both exam systems share identical security:

✅ **Anti-Cheating Detection**
- ESC warning with 10-second countdown
- Immediate auto-submit on tab switch
- Immediate auto-submit on window switch
- Second violation = auto-submit

✅ **One-Time Exam Enforcement**

- Validated against database

✅ **Fullscreen Enforcement**
- Automatic fullscreen on exam start
- Violation tracking if exited

✅ **Question Randomization**
- Each student gets different question order
- Answer options shuffled per student
- Seeded by roll number for consistency

✅ **30-Minute Timer**
- Auto-submit when time expires
- Visual warnings at 10 and 5 minutes
