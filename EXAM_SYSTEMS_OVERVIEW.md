## 🎓 FSMBA System (Existing)

### Students: 31
- **Table:** `students`
- **Results Table:** `exam_results`
- **Unique Code:** `fsmba2026`
- **Questions:** 200+ questions across 9 modules

  - 160525672063, 160525672066, 160525672080, 160525672104, 160525672116, etc.
  - (31 students total)

### Status: ✅ Fully Operational

## 🎓 MBA Regular System (New)

### Students: 229
- **Table:** `mba_regular_students`
- **Results Table:** `mba_regular_exam_results`
- **Unique Code:** `fsmba03`
- **Questions:** Pending (you will provide)
- **Roll Numbers:** 
  - Sequential: 160525672001 through 160525672229
  - (229 students total)

### Status: ⏳ Setup Required
1. ✅ SQL script created (`CREATE_MBA_REGULAR_TABLES.sql`)
2. ⏳ Run SQL script in Supabase
3. ⏳ Provide questions for MBA Regular exam
4. ⏳ Create separate question file or update existing
5. ⏳ Create MBA Regular specific portal (or detect by unique code)

---

## 🔧 Implementation Options

### Option 1: Single Portal with Auto-Detection (Recommended)
- One website detects unique code
- `fsmba2026` → Uses `students` table + `exam_results`
- `fsmba03` → Uses `mba_regular_students` table + `mba_regular_exam_results`
- Loads different question sets based on unique code

**Pros:**
- Single URL for all students
- Easy to manage
- Automatic routing

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex code

### Option 2: Separate Portals
- Two different websites
- Portal 1: FSMBA students (existing)
- Portal 2: MBA Regular students (new)

**Pros:**
- Complete separation
- Easier to customize each

**Cons:**
- Need to maintain two deployments
- More complex for admins

## 📋 Next Steps for MBA Regular

### Step 1: Run SQL Script ⚡
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
CREATE_MBA_REGULAR_TABLES.sql
```

This will:
- Create `mba_regular_students` table
- Create `mba_regular_exam_results` table
- Insert all 229 students
- Set up RLS policies

### Step 2: Provide Questions 📝
You mentioned you'll provide questions for MBA Regular students.
Format needed:
```javascript
{
    question: "Question text here?",
    options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    correct: 0 // Index of correct answer (0-3)
}
```

### Step 3: Choose Implementation Option 🎯
Decide if you want:
- **Option A:** Single portal that detects unique code
- **Option B:** Separate portal for MBA Regular

### Step 4: Configure System 🔧
Based on your choice, I'll:
- Update code to support both systems
- Create separate question banks
- Configure database connections
- Deploy to Vercel

## 🎯 Recommended Next Action

**I recommend Option 1: Single Portal with Auto-Detection**

This means:
1. ✅ Students go to same website URL
2. ✅ Enter roll number + unique code
3. ✅ System automatically detects which exam system
4. ✅ Loads appropriate questions
5. ✅ Saves to correct results table

**Benefits:**
- Easier for students (one URL)
- Easier for admins (one deployment)
- Cleaner management
- Both systems share same anti-cheating features

## 📞 What I Need From You

1. **Run SQL Script:** Execute `CREATE_MBA_REGULAR_TABLES.sql` in Supabase
2. **Provide Questions:** Send MBA Regular exam questions
3. **Confirm Approach:** Single portal or separate portals?

Once you provide the questions, I'll integrate everything! 🚀
